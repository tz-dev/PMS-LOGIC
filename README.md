# PMS–LOGIC

**Structural Responsibility, Logical Limits, and Post-Moral Effects**

**PMS–LOGIC is a formal extension and application of the Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.
While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–LOGIC explores **what follows when this grammar is applied to a classical philosophical tension**: the relation between facts, responsibility, and morality.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation
(see: [https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)),
this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to reconstruct a long-standing problem in moral philosophy.

PMS–LOGIC applies PMS to the tension between **Hume’s “no ought from is”** and the persistent practical intuition that **effective capacity entails responsibility**.

Rather than proposing a new ethics, PMS–LOGIC provides a **strictly praxeological reconstruction** of how *moral readability* and *responsibility* emerge **without normativity**, **without moral laws**, and **without metaphysical grounding**.

The project demonstrates how **logic reaches a structural limit (Λ)** within PMS, and how **responsibility arises post hoc** as an effect of **irreversible praxis under asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ)**, stabilized through **self-binding (Ψ)**.

In this sense, PMS–LOGIC should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **thematically focused on the post-moral effects** that become visible once PMS is applied to ethical discourse.

## What PMS–LOGIC Is

PMS–LOGIC is:

* A **structural analysis of responsibility** without prescriptive ethics  
* A **formal application of PMS (Δ–Ψ)** to moral philosophy and action theory  
* A demonstration of **post-moral effects without moral foundations**
* A **non-normative resolution** of the Is–Ought tension
* A bridge between:
  * philosophy of action  
  * meta-ethics  
  * systems thinking  
  * PMS-based formal modeling  

**Guiding formula:**

> **Pre-moral in justification /  
> Logical in boundary management /  
> Post-moral in effect**

---

## What PMS–LOGIC Is *Not*

PMS–LOGIC is not:

* An ethical theory
* A moral code or value system
* A theory of duties, virtues, or rights
* A psychological or motivational model
* A framework for judging persons
* A system for moral ranking or sanctioning

No PMS operator generates an **“ought.”**  
No norm is derived, hidden, or implied.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–LOGIC shows that:

* **No “ought” follows from “is”** — fully preserving Hume  
* Yet **no irreversible praxis remains innocent**

Responsibility arises **structurally**, not normatively, when:

* **Asymmetry (Ω)** makes effects uneven,
* **Temporality (Θ)** makes effects irreversible,
* **Non-event (Λ)** makes omission consequential,
* **Self-binding (Ψ)** keeps consequences attributable across time.

What appears as *morality* is therefore not law or command, but the  
**readability of consequences after the fact**.

> Responsibility is not commanded.  
> It is what remains.

---

## Relation to PMS
PMS–LOGIC is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* Moral phenomena are treated as **derived interpretive effects**, not primitives

Where PMS provides the **structural grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–LOGIC shows what happens when that grammar is applied to:

* non-closure,
* power,
* omission,
* time,
* and commitment.

## Structural Contributions

### 1. Logic with a Limit
Logic is indispensable for differentiation and integration,  
but reaches a **structural boundary at Non-Closure (Λ)**.

Forcing closure produces dogma.  
Carrying non-closure produces stability.

### 2. Responsibility without Norms
Responsibility is redefined as **attributability of consequences**,  
not obedience to rules.

“Potential obligates” is rewritten as:

> **Potential removes innocence — not freedom.**

### 3. Morality as Readability Field
Morality is neither objective law nor subjective projection, but an  
**interpretive field** that appears once praxis becomes:

* asymmetric,
* irreversible,
* incomplete,
* and self-bound.

### 4. Self-Bindings without Lawgiver
What look like “commandments” are shown to be  
**self-binding stability constraints** — not moral imperatives.

## Links & Resources

*PMS-LOGIC* is situated within a broader **praxeological ecosystem** that connects anthropological theory, formal operator models, applied analyses, and executable specifications.

The resources below provide different **points of access** into that ecosystem: from the book and its conceptual foundations, to related model architectures, reference implementations, and interactive tools. Together, they form a coherent field of inquiry rather than a collection of isolated artifacts.

### Naming Note

The name **PMS-LOGIC** reflects the central thesis of the work — that logic is a beginning, not an end — and is dedicated to Leonard Nimoy.

---

## Final Note

PMS–LOGIC does not tell you what you *ought* to do.

It explains why, once something is done —  
or left undone —  
**it cannot be made morally irrelevant again.**

That remainder is not ethics by decree.

It is ethics **by consequence**.
