# PMS–LOGIC

## Structural Responsibility, Logical Limits, and Post-Moral Effects (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–LOGIC is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–LOGIC reconstructs a classical philosophical tension as a **strictly praxeological configuration**:

- the Is–Ought boundary (Hume),
- the intuition that **effective capacity entails responsibility**,
- and the question why *moral language* reappears **without** moral laws, duties, or metaphysical grounding.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

- why **logic is indispensable** yet reaches a structural boundary at **Non-Closure (Λ)**,
- why “coherence” must not become **closure-authority** (Σ-totalization risk),
- why **responsibility arises post hoc** as **attributability of consequences** under **asymmetry (Ω)** and **irreversibility (Θ)**,
- why omission and “nothing happened” remain structurally consequential via **Λ carried**,
- and why “norm-like” statements in practice are best reconstructed as **failure-mode constraints** (Χ/Ψ restraint), not as “ought.”

In this sense, PMS–LOGIC should be read as:

- **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
- **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
- **focused on structural legibility rather than moral or psychological evaluation**.

## What PMS–LOGIC Is

PMS–LOGIC is:

- A **praxeological reconstruction of responsibility** (no prescriptive ethics)
- A **PMS_1.1–conform application** of the operator set (Δ–Ψ)
- A framework for analysing:

  - the tripartition **pre-moral / logical / post-moral** as reduced operator signatures
  - **non-closure (Λ)** as a structural boundary of explanation (not a defect)
  - responsibility as **attributability** (Ω/Θ/Λ/Ψ), distinct from blame or duty
  - predictable drift forms: **Σ-totalization**, **Ω→authority capture**, **pseudo-ought injection**, **Λ-suppression**, **□-overconstraint**
  - “apparent norms” as **structural failure-mode constraints** (self-binding and restraint), not as prescriptions

- A bridge between:

  - philosophy of action
  - meta-ethics (without ethics construction)
  - systems thinking
  - PMS-based formal modelling (operator-readable annotations)

**Guiding formula:**

> **Pre-moral in justification /  
> Logical in boundary management /  
> Post-moral in effect**

---

## What PMS–LOGIC Is *Not*

PMS–LOGIC is not:

- An ethical theory
- A moral code or value system
- A theory of duties, virtues, or rights
- A psychological, motivational, or clinical model
- A framework for judging persons
- A system for moral ranking, sanctioning, or legitimacy attribution

No PMS operator generates an **“ought.”**  
No norm is derived, hidden, or implied.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–LOGIC preserves Hume fully:

- **No “ought” follows from “is.”**

Yet it also shows a structural remainder:

- **No irreversible praxis remains innocent** (non-innocence is structural, not moral).

Responsibility arises **structurally**, not normatively, when:

- **Asymmetry (Ω)** makes effects uneven,
- **Temporality (Θ)** makes effects irreversible,
- **Non-event (Λ)** makes omission consequential,
- **Self-binding (Ψ)** keeps consequences attributable across time.

What appears as *morality* is therefore not law or command, but the  
**readability of consequences after the fact**.

> Responsibility is not commanded.  
> It is what remains.

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–LOGIC is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in  
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

- No new operators are introduced
- No operator is redefined
- All dependency rules are respected
- All claims remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**
- Moral phenomena are treated as **derived interpretive effects**, not primitives

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**, PMS–LOGIC specifies how that grammar behaves when applied to:

- non-closure and the limits of explanation (Λ under □),
- power and exposure gradients (Ω),
- irreversibility and trajectory costs (Θ),
- omission as consequential structure (Λ),
- and consequence attribution stabilized via self-binding (Ψ).

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS-LOGIC.yaml (That PMS Alone Does Not Provide)

PMS.yaml gives you the **canonical operator system** (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, derived axes (where present), and general governance constraints for structural (non-psychological) reading.

**pms-logic.yaml** adds a domain-specific application profile for *logic / responsibility / post-moral readability* that makes several things **explicitly computable / recordable / comparable** across cases and analysts:

### 1) The tripartition as reduced signatures (named structural checkpoints)

PMS–LOGIC defines three explicit level markers:

- **PRE_MORAL_justification** = Δ + ∇ + □ + Λ + Α  
- **LOGIC_boundary_management** = □ + Λ + Χ + Σ  
- **POST_MORAL_effects** = Ω + Θ + Ψ  

With PMS alone, you can *describe* these chains; with PMS–LOGIC you can treat them as **named reference checkpoints** (not proof chains) across tooling, cases, and papers.

### 2) Moral readability as a non-operator field (minimal signature)

PMS–LOGIC defines a minimal readability marker:

- **MORAL_READABILITY_min** = Ω + Θ + Λ + Ψ  

This keeps “morality” out of the operator set while making its emergence **structurally legible** (post hoc, under asymmetry and irreversibility).

### 3) Effective capacity boundary (no capacity → no responsibility)

PMS–LOGIC encodes an explicit constraint:

- **POTENTIAL_effective** = □ + Θ  

Responsibility presupposes **effective, frame-bound capacity** with temporal availability. Abstract possibility does not generate responsibility.

### 4) Drift typology (predictable closure-authority and pseudo-normativity)

PMS–LOGIC formalizes structural failure modes as a **drift catalogue**, e.g.:

- **dogmatism_sigma_totalization** (Σ becomes closure-authority; Λ denied)  
- **authority_capture_omega_inflation** (Ω becomes justificatory authority; Χ suppressed)  
- **moralism_pseudo_ought_injection** (responsibility → obligation; Ψ externalized into enforcement)  
- **nihilism_lambda_suppression** (Λ erased; omissions treated as irrelevant)  
- **technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint** (□ treated as exhaustive; remainder dismissed)

With PMS alone, you can describe these patterns; PMS–LOGIC makes them **named, repeatable descriptors** for consistent annotation and comparison.

### 5) Failure-mode constraints (apparent “norms” reconstructed non-prescriptively)

PMS–LOGIC adds a constraint layer that treats norm-like statements as **structural stabilizers** (self-binding and restraint), not moral imperatives (no “ought”).

Examples (as constraints, not commands):

- “Do not force closure where Λ persists.”
- “Do not confuse explanatory power with sense-making authority.”
- “Bind yourself to restraint rather than assertion.”

### 6) Axes projection (structural compression, not person-evaluation)

PMS–LOGIC includes **scale matrices** that project the lens onto derived axes (A, C, R, E, D) as a compact comparative summary:

- high awareness/coherence/responsibility emphasis,
- action deliberately constrained by Χ/Σ discipline,
- dignity-in-practice stabilized under Ω/Ψ/Χ.

### 7) Counter-readings (misuse resistance)

PMS–LOGIC explicitly anticipates common misreadings (e.g., “ethics in disguise,” “relativism,” “nihilism,” “theology,” “unfair responsibility”) and provides **structural responses** that keep the profile inside PMS guardrails.

### 8) Example-suite schema for uniform test vectors

PMS–LOGIC provides a uniform, scene-bound schema so examples remain:

- operator-readable,
- reversible,
- non-moral,
- non-diagnostic.

In short:

> PMS is the operator grammar.  
> PMS–LOGIC is the logic profile: tripartition + boundaries + drift + constraints + axes projection + case schema.

## PMS-LOGIC YAML (Addon Specification)

This repository includes **pms-logic.yaml** as an addon specification:

- It **DEPENDS on PMS_1.1** and references Δ–Ψ strictly.
- It defines reduced signatures, drift catalogue, failure-mode constraints, scale matrices, counter-readings, glossary, and example-suite schema.
- It explicitly separates:

  - **operator grammar** (PMS)
  - from **application profile** (PMS–LOGIC)

### Minimal “scene packet” skeleton (for tooling / uniform mappings)

```yaml
scene_label: "Example: policy decision under deep uncertainty"
frame_anchor (□): "government response planning under incomplete data"
structural_trigger (Δ): "mismatch between stakes and available justification"
non_closure (Λ): "irreducible remainder: what cannot be known or settled"
operator_signature: ["□","Δ","Λ","Θ","Ω","Σ","Χ","Ψ"]  # reduced signature, not proof
tripartition_tag: "logical_boundary_management"
guardrail_gate: "Χ + reversibility + D"
structural_closure: >
  Non-closure persists within the frame and cannot be eliminated without substitution.
  Integration coordinates options, but distance prevents closure-authority.
  Responsibility remains capacity-bounded and attributable under asymmetry and time.
drift_markers: ["dogmatism_sigma_totalization","technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"]
failure_mode_constraint_refs: ["FMC2","FMC3"]
````

This packet format is optional, but it is designed to make case mappings **uniform, reversible, and non-ought**.

---

## Model Specification (Human-Readable)

Alongside the YAML, this repo also contains (or is meant to contain) a **human-readable model specification** (HTML/PDF) that:

* explains the YAML structure in technical prose,
* makes the tripartition, drift catalogue, and constraint layer legible,
* and clarifies guardrails and non-goals.

Intended reading order:

1. PMS base grammar (PMS.yaml)
2. pms-logic.yaml (tripartition + drift + constraints + axes projection + case schema)
3. Paper text (PMS–LOGIC)
4. Example Suite (stress tests)

---

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The repository includes a dedicated **Example Suite** (`/examples`) consisting of five structurally uniform case mappings.

These examples are **not illustrations, prescriptions, or moral verdicts**.
They function as **operator-legible scene packets** that stress-test PMS–LOGIC under load:

* **capacity-bounded responsibility** (effective, frame-bound capacity rather than abstract possibility),
* **Λ carried** (non-closure as a structural remainder rather than a defect),
* **post-moral readability** (attributability under Ω/Θ/Λ/Ψ without prescriptive “ought”),
* and typical failure modes (Σ-totalization, Ω→authority capture, Λ-suppression, pseudo-ought injection).

Included examples:

1. **Disaster triage** (scarcity, allocation, irreducible remainder)
2. **Whistleblowing** (informational capacity, omission, institutional risk)
3. **Policy under deep uncertainty** (non-closure under decision pressure)
4. **Platform moderation** (metrics as authority, opacity as Λ)
5. **Family care asymmetry** (trajectory responsibility without implicit duty)

## Structural Contributions

### 1) Logic with a Limit (Λ carried, not eliminated)

Logic is indispensable for differentiation and integration,
but reaches a **structural boundary at Non-Closure (Λ)**.

Forcing closure produces dogma.
Carrying non-closure produces stability.

### 2) Responsibility without Norms (attributability, not obligation)

Responsibility is reconstructed as **attributability of consequences**,
not obedience to rules.

The everyday trope “potential obligates” is rewritten as:

> **Potential removes innocence — not freedom.**

(Responsibility is capacity-bounded: effective capacity within □ across Θ.)

### 3) Morality as a Readability Field (non-operator)

Morality is neither objective law nor subjective projection, but an
**interpretive field** that appears once praxis becomes:

* asymmetric,
* irreversible,
* incomplete,
* and self-bound.

### 4) Self-Bindings without Lawgiver (constraints, not imperatives)

What look like “commandments” are shown to be
**self-binding stability constraints** — not moral imperatives.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions, critiques, and structural questions are welcome.
Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Contribution scope (structural only)

Contributions are especially welcome for:

* additional example packets that follow the schema and guardrails,
* clarifications to drift signatures (operator-readable, non-moral),
* improvements to interoperability notes (tooling adapters, schema alignment),
* documentation improvements that strengthen reversibility and dignity-in-practice,
* parsers/validators that consume PMS.yaml + pms-logic.yaml without reimplementing operators.

Contributions are out of scope if they:

* introduce new operators,
* redefine PMS operator dependencies,
* add person-typing, motive attribution, or diagnostic language,
* turn drift labels into enforcement or sanction mechanisms,
* translate responsibility into “ought” as if licensed by the model.

### Naming Note

The name **PMS-LOGIC** reflects the central thesis of the work — that logic is a beginning, not an end — and is dedicated to Leonard Nimoy.

---

## Final Note

PMS–LOGIC does not tell you what you *ought* to do.

It explains why, once something is done —
or left undone —
**it cannot be made morally irrelevant again.**

That remainder is not ethics by decree.

It is ethics **by consequence**.
