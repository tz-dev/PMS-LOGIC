# Example 1 — Disaster Triage Without a Moral Code

## 1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)
- **Context:** A large-scale disaster with multiple injured persons and severely limited medical resources.
- **Stakes:** Immediate loss of life is possible; decisions shape irreversible outcomes.
- **What is structurally at issue (not morally):** Allocation under scarcity where not all needs can be met within the available frame.

## 2. Frame Validity (□)
- **Role space:** Emergency responders assigned to triage and stabilization.
- **Scope boundaries:** Only actions feasible within current resources, time windows, and institutional mandate count as possible.
- **What is out of frame:** Ideal care for all, retrospective blame, or value rankings of persons.

## 3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)
- **Key distinctions (Δ):**
  - Treatable vs. non-treatable within time window.
  - Immediate intervention vs. delayed intervention.
- **Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):**
  - Some patients will not receive treatment at all.
  - Some interventions will not occur before critical deterioration.
- **Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):**
  - Established triage protocols as recurrent response patterns under scarcity.

## 4. Asymmetry & Temporality (Ω, Θ)
- **Exposure gradients (Ω):**
  - Responders hold asymmetric power over access to life-saving intervention.
- **Capacity gradients (Ω):**
  - Capacity is finite, situational, and role-bound; responders cannot exceed it without structural collapse.
- **Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):**
  - Missed interventions cannot be undone; time closes options non-symmetrically.

## 5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)
- **Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):**
  - Given role-bound capacity and asymmetry, certain outcomes can be structurally traced to decisions.
- **How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:**
  - Not treating a patient is a Λ within the frame and thus carries attributable consequences, even absent prescription.

## 6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)
- **What cannot be closed inside the frame:**
  - No allocation rule can eliminate all loss or justify outcomes as fully resolved.
- **Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):**
  - Pressure to declare the chosen triage logic as “the right one” rather than as capacity-bound necessity.

## 7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)
- **Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):**
  - Shifting from “best outcome overall” to “maximal use of available capacity.”
- **Distance enforcement (Χ):**
  - Suspension of moral verdicts about worth; focus on structural conditions.
- **Integration without totalization (Σ):**
  - Coordinating medical criteria and time constraints without claiming moral completeness.
- **Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):**
  - Responders remain bound to their role and protocol across cases, enabling consistent attribution without moral elevation.

## 8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes
- **Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):**
  - Treating the triage protocol as morally exhaustive.
- **Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):**
  - Inferring “therefore one must save X” beyond capacity.
- **Nihilism (Λ-suppression):**
  - Claiming “nothing matters because loss is unavoidable.”
- **Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):**
  - Equating responder power with moral truth.
- **Frame lock (□-overconstraint):**
  - Refusing to acknowledge when the frame itself collapses.

## 9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)
- **Structural mapping:** Δ/Λ/Α under Ω and Θ yield attributable outcomes.
- **Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):** Responsibility tracks effective, frame-bound capacity only.
- **What remains open (Λ carried):** Irreducible loss and unresolved remainder.
- **No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:** Moral readability without “ought.”

## 10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)

In disaster triage, the *felt* moral pressure does not arise because a hidden norm has been smuggled in. It arises because praxis is **irreversible (Θ)**, **asymmetrical (Ω)**, and **frame-bound (□)**. Once responders occupy a role that includes *effective capacity* (bounded but real), action and non-action stop being neutral. That is the entire mechanism of **moral readability** in PMS–LOGIC: not an “ought,” but **attributability** under scarcity.

The decisive point is the **capacity boundary**. PMS–LOGIC does not treat “could have saved everyone” as relevant, because abstract possibility is not capacity. Responsibility tracks what was **structurally available** in the operative frame (means, access, authority, time window). Within that boundary, a triage decision produces a distribution of consequences that is traceable to the decision process—hence *non-innocence* of omission. Outside that boundary, attribution does not apply. This prevents both moral inflation (“you were obliged to do the impossible”) and moral erasure (“it was chaos, so nothing belongs to anyone”).

Logic’s role here is **ordering and boundary management**, not justification-as-authority. A triage rule can integrate constraints (Σ) and stabilize action under pressure, but it cannot deliver final closure because **Λ persists**: some losses remain structurally unavoidable. PMS–LOGIC treats this remainder as a *strength*—it blocks the move from “this is the best we can do here” to “this is the right outcome, therefore justified.” Closure-pressure will appear (∇), especially when the system seeks emotional or institutional relief; the model’s discipline is to **carry Λ** rather than to compensate it with dogma.

Distance (Χ) and dignity-in-practice (D) matter exactly at this point. Χ prevents responders from converting their asymmetric position into epistemic or moral supremacy; D prevents the frame from sliding into implicit ranking of persons. Integration (Σ) keeps the enactment coherent without claiming moral completeness, and self-binding (Ψ) keeps attribution stable: responders remain accountable to the role’s constraint-regime over time without turning accountability into condemnation or sanctification.

So the triage case functions as a clean test vector: **pre-moral structure** (scarcity, roles, frames, non-events), **logical boundary discipline** (coherence without closure), and **post-moral readability** (attributable consequences under Ω/Θ/Λ/Ψ). The model thereby explains why triage is unavoidably “morally readable” while staying strictly non-prescriptive: it yields no code, no ranking, no sanction—only a precise map of where responsibility becomes structurally legible, and where it must stop.
