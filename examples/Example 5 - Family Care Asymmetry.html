			<h2><em>Example 5: Family Care Asymmetry</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Context:</strong> An adult family member informally provides ongoing care to an elderly relative.</li>
			<li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Health outcomes, dependency, caregiver burnout, long-term life trajectories.</li>
			<li><strong>What is structurally at issue (not morally):</strong> How responsibility becomes attributable through asymmetry and time without commands.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Frame Validity (□)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role space:</strong> Caregiver, care recipient, extended family, healthcare services.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> Informal care capacity, access to services, cultural expectations, time availability.</li>
			<li><strong>What is out of frame:</strong> Idealized family norms, heroism narratives, total obligation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Key distinctions (Δ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Available vs. unavailable support.</li>
			<li>Immediate care vs. deferred care.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Gaps in service provision.</li>
			<li>Missed interventions due to fatigue or limits.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):</strong><ul>
			<li>Routine reliance on the same caregiver.</li>
			<li>Normalization of partial care.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry &amp; Temporality (Ω, Θ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exposure gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Care recipient’s vulnerability vs. caregiver’s relative capacity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Capacity gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Care capacity is finite, role- and time-bound.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Health declines accumulate; missed care has lasting effects.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):</strong><ul>
			<li>Sustained capacity under asymmetry and time makes outcomes traceable to the caregiving trajectory.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:</strong><ul>
			<li>Non-provision within the frame functions as Λ and shapes consequences.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>What cannot be closed inside the frame:</strong><ul>
			<li>No allocation resolves all needs or losses.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):</strong><ul>
			<li>Pressure to declare “the right balance” as final.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):</strong><ul>
			<li>From “total care” to “sustainable care within capacity.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Distance enforcement (Χ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Restraining escalation and moral self-judgment.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Integration without totalization (Σ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Coordinating care, limits, and supports without completeness claims.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Continuity of commitment enables responsibility without prescription.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating one care pattern as exhaustive.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):</strong><ul>
			<li>Translating care into unconditional duty.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Nihilism (Λ-suppression):</strong><ul>
			<li>Claiming limits erase responsibility.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):</strong><ul>
			<li>Vulnerability used to command without capacity checks.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Frame lock (□-overconstraint):</strong><ul>
			<li>Ignoring alternative supports outside the immediate frame.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Structural mapping:</strong> Δ/Λ/Α under Ω and Θ with Ψ stabilizing attribution.</li>
			<li><strong>Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):</strong> Responsibility tracks effective, sustainable capacity.</li>
			<li><strong>What remains open (Λ carried):</strong> Irreducible loss and unmet needs.</li>
			<li><strong>No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:</strong> Moral readability without “ought.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)</h2>
			<p>The family care case makes visible one of the most persistent confusions PMS–LOGIC is designed to dissolve: the slide from <strong>structural responsibility</strong> into <strong>implicit obligation</strong>. Moral pressure appears here not because a family norm commands care, but because <strong>asymmetry (Ω)</strong> and <strong>irreversible time (Θ)</strong> render care and non-care consequential once a person occupies a position of <em>effective, ongoing capacity</em> within a shared frame (□).</p>
			<p>What produces moral readability is <strong>continuity under asymmetry</strong>, not prescription. As long as care capacity exists—however limited—actions and omissions shape health trajectories that cannot be reset. Missed appointments, delayed responses, or sustained partial care are <strong>Λ-events</strong>: structured absences that matter precisely because expectations and dependencies are already in place. Responsibility becomes readable because outcomes attach to a <strong>caregiving trajectory</strong>, not because an agent violated a duty.</p>
			<p>The decisive safeguard in this example is the <strong>capacity boundary</strong>. PMS–LOGIC does not treat “being family” as responsibility-generating. Responsibility tracks <strong>effective, sustainable capacity within time</strong>, not abstract kinship or moral expectation. Where capacity collapses—through exhaustion, lack of access, or closed windows—attribution must also stop. This blocks the two dominant misreadings: moralism (“you must always do more”) and nihilism (“since you cannot do everything, nothing counts”).</p>
			<p>Logic reaches its limit here in the attempt to compute a final balance—<em>the</em> right amount of care. No such closure is structurally available. <strong>Λ persists</strong> because needs exceed capacity and losses cannot be eliminated. Closure-pressure (∇) appears as self-judgment, guilt narratives, or external evaluation, pushing Σ toward totalization. PMS–LOGIC insists that Λ be <strong>carried</strong>, not resolved: there is no final justification that would render the remainder harmless.</p>
			<p>Distance (Χ) is therefore not withdrawal from care, but protection against escalation. Χ prevents vulnerability (Ω) from being converted into command, and prevents responsibility from collapsing into self-accusation. Integration (Σ) coordinates care, limits, and supports into a livable pattern without claiming completeness. Recontextualization (Φ) allows shifts—new services, shared care, changed roles—without erasing prior consequences.</p>
			<p>Self-binding (Ψ) stabilizes attribution without turning it into obligation. The caregiver remains a continuous bearer of consequences across time, not because they <em>ought</em> to be, but because the trajectory of care is theirs insofar as capacity persists. This is responsibility as <strong>non-innocence</strong>, not as command: consequences belong where capacity and continuity exist.</p>
			<p>The family care case thus exemplifies PMS–LOGIC at its most everyday and most easily distorted. It shows why moral language inevitably appears around care, and why importing duties or denying responsibility both misread the structure. What remains is neither mandate nor absolution, but a clear articulation of how <strong>responsibility becomes readable under asymmetry and time</strong>, and why it must remain <strong>capacity-bounded, non-totalized, and carried without an “ought.”</strong></p>
