			<h2><em>Example 4: Platform Moderation</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Context:</strong> A large online platform enforces content moderation policies using algorithmic scoring and internal guidelines.</li>
			<li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Speech visibility, account access, reputational and economic effects at scale.</li>
			<li><strong>What is structurally at issue (not morally):</strong> How logical procedures and metrics become authority under asymmetry, without introducing norms.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Frame Validity (□)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role space:</strong> Platform moderators, policy teams, automated systems, affected users.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> Terms of service, enforcement pipelines, appeal mechanisms, latency constraints.</li>
			<li><strong>What is out of frame:</strong> Comprehensive truth adjudication, moral evaluation of speech, societal consensus.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Key distinctions (Δ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Allowed vs. restricted content.</li>
			<li>Flagged vs. unflagged behavior.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Absence of case-specific justification for many decisions.</li>
			<li>Non-delivery of individualized explanations within time windows.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):</strong><ul>
			<li>Recurrent reliance on scores, thresholds, and precedents.</li>
			<li>Habitual deferral to “policy says so.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry &amp; Temporality (Ω, Θ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exposure gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Platform decisions disproportionately affect users with limited recourse.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Capacity gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Enforcement capacity exceeds user capacity to contest or understand outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Visibility loss and account actions have lasting effects; appeals are time-bound.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):</strong><ul>
			<li>Concentrated enforcement capacity under time renders outcomes traceable to platform trajectories.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:</strong><ul>
			<li>Failure to review, explain, or correct decisions functions as Λ within the frame.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>What cannot be closed inside the frame:</strong><ul>
			<li>Metrics cannot exhaust meaning, context, or downstream effects.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):</strong><ul>
			<li>“Rational necessity” rhetoric used to seal decisions against contestation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):</strong><ul>
			<li>From “objective enforcement” to “capacity-bounded governance.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Distance enforcement (Χ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Preventing metric outputs from becoming justificatory authority.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Integration without totalization (Σ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Coordinating rules, signals, and uncertainty without claiming completeness.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Owning long-term effects across policy iterations and appeals.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating models as final arbiters.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):</strong><ul>
			<li>Converting enforcement into moral condemnation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Nihilism (Λ-suppression):</strong><ul>
			<li>Denying omission effects (“the system decided”).</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):</strong><ul>
			<li>Power laundering through “logic.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Frame lock (□-overconstraint):</strong><ul>
			<li>Assuming platform frames exhaust public meaning.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Structural mapping:</strong> Δ/Λ/Α under Ω and Θ; Χ/Σ constrain closure.</li>
			<li><strong>Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):</strong> Responsibility tracks enforcement capacity and persistence.</li>
			<li><strong>What remains open (Λ carried):</strong> Contextual remainder and appeal gaps.</li>
			<li><strong>No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:</strong> Moral readability without “ought.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)</h2>
			<p>This case shows with particular clarity how <strong>logic turns into authority</strong> when its structural limits are not carried. The platform does not appear morally charged because it enforces values or issues commands, but because it holds <strong>concentrated, persistent capacity (Ω)</strong> over users’ visibility and access, exercised across <strong>irreversible time (Θ)</strong>. Once this capacity is in place, moderation outcomes—actions <em>and omissions</em>—become structurally attributable, regardless of whether anyone intended moral judgment.</p>
			<p>The central mechanism is <strong>authority capture via logic</strong>. Metrics, thresholds, and procedural rules are legitimate tools of integration (Σ): they reduce complexity and enable scalable coordination. The failure occurs when these tools are rhetorically elevated into <strong>justificatory closure</strong>—“the system is rational,” “the model decided,” “policy required it.” At that point, <strong>Λ is denied</strong>. The persistent remainder—unmodeled context, lost nuance, downstream harm—does not disappear, but becomes invisible, displaced, or externalized.</p>
			<p>Moral readability emerges precisely here. Users experience moderation as “moralized” not because norms are stated, but because <strong>consequences are asymmetric and durable</strong> while explanation is withheld. The <strong>non-event (Λ)</strong>—missing justification, absent review, silence in appeals—functions as an active structural element. It stabilizes outcomes while blocking contestation, making responsibility legible even in the absence of explicit blame or sanction.</p>
			<p>PMS–LOGIC clarifies why neither of the common counter-moves works. Declaring enforcement “purely technical” is a form of <strong>Λ-suppression</strong>: it denies that omissions and opacity matter under Ω and Θ. Conversely, condemning moderation as moral censorship injects a <strong>pseudo-ought</strong>, collapsing attribution into accusation. Both miss the structural point. Responsibility here tracks <strong>effective enforcement capacity over time</strong>, not moral intent and not algorithmic necessity.</p>
			<p>Distance (Χ) is therefore decisive. Without Χ, integration (Σ) slides into totalization: models become final arbiters, and asymmetry (Ω) is laundered into epistemic authority. With Χ, logic remains what PMS–LOGIC allows it to be: a boundary-management instrument that coordinates action while openly carrying Λ. Recontextualization (Φ) then becomes possible—seeing moderation not as truth enforcement, but as <strong>capacity-bounded governance under uncertainty</strong>.</p>
			<p>Self-binding (Ψ) stabilizes attribution across time. Even as policies change and systems evolve, responsibility does not reset with each update. The platform remains a continuous trajectory that owns the effects of its enforcement patterns and omissions. This is not moral condemnation; it is <strong>structural non-innocence</strong> under persistent capacity.</p>
			<p>The moderation case thus crystallizes a core warning of PMS–LOGIC: when logic is allowed to masquerade as authority, morality reappears in distorted form—through resentment, accusation, and legitimacy crises. The alternative is not norm-setting, but discipline: <strong>carry Λ, maintain Χ, integrate without totalization, and bind responsibility to capacity over time</strong>. Moral readability then emerges as an unavoidable effect of structure, not as a verdict imposed from above.</p>
