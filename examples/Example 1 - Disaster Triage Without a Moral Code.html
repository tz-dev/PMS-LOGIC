			<h2><em>Example 1: Disaster Triage Without a Moral Code</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Context:</strong> A large-scale disaster with multiple injured persons and severely limited medical resources.</li>
			<li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Immediate loss of life is possible; decisions shape irreversible outcomes.</li>
			<li><strong>What is structurally at issue (not morally):</strong> Allocation under scarcity where not all needs can be met within the available frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Frame Validity (□)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role space:</strong> Emergency responders assigned to triage and stabilization.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> Only actions feasible within current resources, time windows, and institutional mandate count as possible.</li>
			<li><strong>What is out of frame:</strong> Ideal care for all, retrospective blame, or value rankings of persons.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Key distinctions (Δ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treatable vs. non-treatable within time window.</li>
			<li>Immediate intervention vs. delayed intervention.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Some patients will not receive treatment at all.</li>
			<li>Some interventions will not occur before critical deterioration.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):</strong><ul>
			<li>Established triage protocols as recurrent response patterns under scarcity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry &amp; Temporality (Ω, Θ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exposure gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Responders hold asymmetric power over access to life-saving intervention.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Capacity gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Capacity is finite, situational, and role-bound; responders cannot exceed it without structural collapse.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Missed interventions cannot be undone; time closes options non-symmetrically.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):</strong><ul>
			<li>Given role-bound capacity and asymmetry, certain outcomes can be structurally traced to decisions.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:</strong><ul>
			<li>Not treating a patient is a Λ within the frame and thus carries attributable consequences, even absent prescription.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>What cannot be closed inside the frame:</strong><ul>
			<li>No allocation rule can eliminate all loss or justify outcomes as fully resolved.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):</strong><ul>
			<li>Pressure to declare the chosen triage logic as “the right one” rather than as capacity-bound necessity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):</strong><ul>
			<li>Shifting from “best outcome overall” to “maximal use of available capacity.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Distance enforcement (Χ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Suspension of moral verdicts about worth; focus on structural conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Integration without totalization (Σ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Coordinating medical criteria and time constraints without claiming moral completeness.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Responders remain bound to their role and protocol across cases, enabling consistent attribution without moral elevation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating the triage protocol as morally exhaustive.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):</strong><ul>
			<li>Inferring “therefore one must save X” beyond capacity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Nihilism (Λ-suppression):</strong><ul>
			<li>Claiming “nothing matters because loss is unavoidable.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):</strong><ul>
			<li>Equating responder power with moral truth.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Frame lock (□-overconstraint):</strong><ul>
			<li>Refusing to acknowledge when the frame itself collapses.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Structural mapping:</strong> Δ/Λ/Α under Ω and Θ yield attributable outcomes.</li>
			<li><strong>Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):</strong> Responsibility tracks effective, frame-bound capacity only.</li>
			<li><strong>What remains open (Λ carried):</strong> Irreducible loss and unresolved remainder.</li>
			<li><strong>No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:</strong> Moral readability without “ought.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)</h2>
			<p>In disaster triage, the <em>felt</em> moral pressure does not arise because a hidden norm has been smuggled in. It arises because praxis is <strong>irreversible (Θ)</strong>, <strong>asymmetrical (Ω)</strong>, and <strong>frame-bound (□)</strong>. Once responders occupy a role that includes <em>effective capacity</em> (bounded but real), action and non-action stop being neutral. That is the entire mechanism of <strong>moral readability</strong> in PMS–LOGIC: not an “ought,” but <strong>attributability</strong> under scarcity.</p>
			<p>The decisive point is the <strong>capacity boundary</strong>. PMS–LOGIC does not treat “could have saved everyone” as relevant, because abstract possibility is not capacity. Responsibility tracks what was <strong>structurally available</strong> in the operative frame (means, access, authority, time window). Within that boundary, a triage decision produces a distribution of consequences that is traceable to the decision process—hence <em>non-innocence</em> of omission. Outside that boundary, attribution does not apply. This prevents both moral inflation (“you were obliged to do the impossible”) and moral erasure (“it was chaos, so nothing belongs to anyone”).</p>
			<p>Logic’s role here is <strong>ordering and boundary management</strong>, not justification-as-authority. A triage rule can integrate constraints (Σ) and stabilize action under pressure, but it cannot deliver final closure because <strong>Λ persists</strong>: some losses remain structurally unavoidable. PMS–LOGIC treats this remainder as a <em>strength</em>—it blocks the move from “this is the best we can do here” to “this is the right outcome, therefore justified.” Closure-pressure will appear (∇), especially when the system seeks emotional or institutional relief; the model’s discipline is to <strong>carry Λ</strong> rather than to compensate it with dogma.</p>
			<p>Distance (Χ) and dignity-in-practice (D) matter exactly at this point. Χ prevents responders from converting their asymmetric position into epistemic or moral supremacy; D prevents the frame from sliding into implicit ranking of persons. Integration (Σ) keeps the enactment coherent without claiming moral completeness, and self-binding (Ψ) keeps attribution stable: responders remain accountable to the role’s constraint-regime over time without turning accountability into condemnation or sanctification.</p>
			<p>So the triage case functions as a clean test vector: <strong>pre-moral structure</strong> (scarcity, roles, frames, non-events), <strong>logical boundary discipline</strong> (coherence without closure), and <strong>post-moral readability</strong> (attributable consequences under Ω/Θ/Λ/Ψ). The model thereby explains why triage is unavoidably “morally readable” while staying strictly non-prescriptive: it yields no code, no ranking, no sanction—only a precise map of where responsibility becomes structurally legible, and where it must stop.</p>
