			<h2><em>Example 2: The Whistleblower Case</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Context:</strong> An employee becomes aware of serious internal misconduct within an organization.</li>
			<li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Potential harm to third parties, institutional integrity, and personal risk.</li>
			<li><strong>What is structurally at issue (not morally):</strong> Whether omission (non-reporting) within a role-bound frame becomes attributable under asymmetry and time.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Frame Validity (□)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role space:</strong> Employee operating under contractual, legal, and procedural constraints.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> What can be reported through existing channels; protections and risks defined by policy.</li>
			<li><strong>What is out of frame:</strong> Heroic expectations, retrospective purity tests, or global judgments about character.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Key distinctions (Δ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Knowledge vs. ignorance.</li>
			<li>Internal reporting vs. external disclosure.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Failure to report within a known reporting window.</li>
			<li>Silence where procedural escalation is expected.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):</strong><ul>
			<li>Organizational norms that normalize silence or delay.</li>
			<li>Recurrent deferral to “someone else will act.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry &amp; Temporality (Ω, Θ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exposure gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Organization holds power over employment; employee holds localized informational asymmetry.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Capacity gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Reporting capacity is role- and channel-bound; exposure to retaliation is asymmetric.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Delayed reporting increases harm and forecloses remedial options.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):</strong><ul>
			<li>Given access to information and role-defined channels, outcomes can be structurally traced to silence or action.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:</strong><ul>
			<li>Silence functions as Λ within the frame; it stabilizes harm trajectories without invoking prescriptions.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>What cannot be closed inside the frame:</strong><ul>
			<li>The frame cannot guarantee safety, fairness, or justice outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):</strong><ul>
			<li>Pressure to declare whistleblowing universally mandatory or universally impossible.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):</strong><ul>
			<li>Reframing from “moral courage” to “capacity-bounded disclosure.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Distance enforcement (Χ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Holding back from valorization or condemnation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Integration without totalization (Σ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Coordinating risk, channel availability, and temporal urgency without collapsing to a rule.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Consistent commitment to procedural integrity over time enables stable attribution without moral escalation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating disclosure as an absolute duty regardless of capacity.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):</strong><ul>
			<li>Converting attribution into command.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Nihilism (Λ-suppression):</strong><ul>
			<li>Claiming silence is neutral because outcomes are uncertain.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):</strong><ul>
			<li>Letting institutional power define truth or responsibility.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Frame lock (□-overconstraint):</strong><ul>
			<li>Assuming existing channels exhaust all structural options.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Structural mapping:</strong> Δ (knowledge) + Λ (silence) + Α (normalized delay) under Ω and Θ.</li>
			<li><strong>Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):</strong> Responsibility tracks access, role, and temporal window.</li>
			<li><strong>What remains open (Λ carried):</strong> Residual risk and unresolved harm.</li>
			<li><strong>No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:</strong> Moral readability without “ought.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)</h2>
			<p>In the whistleblower case, the appearance of moral pressure does not originate in a hidden duty to report, nor in an implicit ideal of courage. It arises because <strong>information becomes structurally consequential</strong> once it is held under a <strong>role-defined frame (□)</strong>, within <strong>asymmetric power relations (Ω)</strong>, and across <strong>irreversible time (Θ)</strong>. From that moment on, silence is no longer a neutral absence; it becomes a <strong>Non-Event (Λ)</strong> that actively shapes outcome trajectories.</p>
			<p>The decisive mechanism is again the <strong>capacity boundary</strong>. PMS–LOGIC does not treat “could have spoken out in principle” as responsibility-generating. Responsibility tracks <strong>effective, frame-bound capacity</strong>: access to channels, temporal availability, and realistic exposure conditions. Where such capacity exists, omission loses innocence; where it does not, attribution does not arise. This distinction prevents both moral inflation (“you were obliged to sacrifice yourself”) and moral evasion (“nothing was required, so nothing belongs to anyone”).</p>
			<p>What makes the case particularly instructive is the role of <strong>Λ under institutional frames</strong>. Silence here is not an empty gap but a <strong>stabilizing absence</strong> that interacts with existing attractors (Α): normalized delay, diffusion of responsibility, and procedural deferral. Under temporality (Θ), these patterns compound harm. Moral readability emerges <em>post hoc</em> because consequences become traceable to a structurally sustained omission—not because a norm was violated.</p>
			<p>Logic’s temptation in this scene is binary closure: either whistleblowing is declared <strong>universally mandatory</strong>, or it is declared <strong>structurally impossible</strong>. Both moves exceed logic’s legitimate role. PMS–LOGIC insists that <strong>Λ must be carried</strong>: the frame cannot guarantee safety, justice, or fairness, and this non-closure cannot be repaired by rule-making or exemption doctrines. Integration (Σ) is used only to coordinate risks, channels, and timing—not to produce a final verdict.</p>
			<p>Distance (Χ) is critical to avoid moral theater. Without Χ, attribution collapses into praise or blame, and self-binding (Ψ) is replaced by external pressure. With Χ, self-binding remains what it is in PMS–LOGIC: <strong>attribution-stability across time</strong>, not moral elevation. The employee remains a structurally identifiable bearer of consequences where capacity existed, without being transformed into a hero, traitor, or moral exemplar.</p>
			<p>The whistleblower case thus sharpens the PMS–LOGIC thesis: <strong>responsibility emerges as non-innocence of omission under asymmetry and time</strong>, not as obligation. It shows precisely where people tend to misread the structure—by importing norms, forcing closure, or denying Λ—and why PMS–LOGIC resists all three. What remains is neither command nor excuse, but a disciplined account of how silence becomes readable as responsibility once praxis has already done its irreversible work.</p>
