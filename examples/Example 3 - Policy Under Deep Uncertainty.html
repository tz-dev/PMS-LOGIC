			<h2><em>Example 3: Policy Under Deep Uncertainty</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>1. Scene (Praxeological Setup)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Context:</strong> A public policy team must decide on interventions under deep uncertainty (incomplete models, contested evidence, long-term effects).</li>
			<li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Large-scale, irreversible consequences across populations and time.</li>
			<li><strong>What is structurally at issue (not morally):</strong> How decision-structuring proceeds when closure is structurally unavailable, without converting logic into authority.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Frame Validity (□)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Role space:</strong> Policy analysts, decision-makers, advisory bodies operating within institutional mandates.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> Available data, modeling capacity, legal authority, and decision timelines.</li>
			<li><strong>What is out of frame:</strong> Moral doctrines, comprehensive value rankings, and guarantees of optimal outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3. Structural Facts (Δ, Λ, Α)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Key distinctions (Δ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Known vs. unknown effects.</li>
			<li>Modeled vs. unmodeled risks.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Expected non-events / omissions (Λ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Absence of decisive evidence.</li>
			<li>No final model convergence before action deadlines.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stabilized patterns / attractors (Α):</strong><ul>
			<li>Recurrent reliance on expert models despite acknowledged incompleteness.</li>
			<li>Habitual framing of uncertainty as “temporary.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry &amp; Temporality (Ω, Θ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Exposure gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Policymakers shape conditions affecting many who lack reciprocal influence.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Capacity gradients (Ω):</strong><ul>
			<li>Decision authority exceeds epistemic certainty; modeling capacity is bounded.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Irreversibility / closing windows (Θ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Policy choices commit resources and trajectories that cannot be fully reversed.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5. Where “Moral Readability” Emerges (Post-Moral Field)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Why consequences become attributable (without “ought”):</strong><ul>
			<li>Effective decision capacity under asymmetry and time renders outcomes traceable to policy trajectories.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How omission/non-action becomes non-neutral:</strong><ul>
			<li>Delaying or deferring decisions functions as Λ within the frame, redistributing risk over time.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Logic’s Legitimate Limit (Λ as boundary)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>What cannot be closed inside the frame:</strong><ul>
			<li>Uncertainty cannot be eliminated by additional modeling within available time.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Where closure-pressure appears (∇ → Σ-totalization risk):</strong><ul>
			<li>Pressure to declare a policy “logically necessary” to compensate for non-closure.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Boundary Management Operators (Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimal recontextualization (Φ) (if needed):</strong><ul>
			<li>Shifting from “optimal solution” to “capacity-consistent response under uncertainty.”</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Distance enforcement (Χ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Resisting the elevation of models into justificatory authority.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Integration without totalization (Σ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Coordinating evidence, uncertainty, and institutional limits without claiming completeness.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Self-binding as attribution-stability (Ψ):</strong><ul>
			<li>Commitment to owning consequences across policy revisions and time.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. Typical Misreads / Failure Modes</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Dogmatism (Σ→total closure):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating provisional models as final truth.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Moralism (pseudo-ought injection):</strong><ul>
			<li>Translating uncertainty into prescriptive imperatives.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Nihilism (Λ-suppression):</strong><ul>
			<li>Claiming uncertainty absolves responsibility.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Authority capture (Ω→epistemic authority):</strong><ul>
			<li>Power positions redefining uncertainty as resolved.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Frame lock (□-overconstraint):</strong><ul>
			<li>Treating the policy frame as exhaustive of reality.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PMS–LOGIC Output (Allowed Outputs Only)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Structural mapping:</strong> Δ/Λ/Α under Ω and Θ with Χ/Σ as boundary management.</li>
			<li><strong>Attribution conditions (capacity-bounded):</strong> Responsibility tracks effective decision capacity, not certainty.</li>
			<li><strong>What remains open (Λ carried):</strong> Persistent uncertainty and unmodeled effects.</li>
			<li><strong>No prescriptions, no rankings, no sanctions:</strong> Moral readability without “ought.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. Conclusion (PMS–LOGIC Takeaway)</h2>
			<p>In policy under deep uncertainty, the pressure that often gets labeled “moral urgency” does not stem from a concealed obligation to choose correctly. It emerges because <strong>decisions are structurally unavoidable</strong> once an institution holds <strong>effective decision capacity (Ω)</strong> and time advances irreversibly (<strong>Θ</strong>). Even in the absence of decisive knowledge, choosing, postponing, or defaulting becomes <strong>attributable praxis</strong>. Moral readability arises here not from certainty, but from <strong>exposure to consequences under non-closure (Λ)</strong>.</p>
			<p>The critical clarification concerns <strong>knowledge versus capacity</strong>. PMS–LOGIC explicitly rejects the idea that responsibility requires epistemic completeness. What matters is not whether policymakers <em>know enough</em>, but whether they <strong>can act within a frame (□)</strong> and whether their actions or omissions shape trajectories that cannot later be undone. Where such capacity exists, non-action is not neutral: delay redistributes risk, locks in paths, and privileges some exposures over others. This produces non-innocence without generating any prescriptive demand to “act now” or “act decisively.”</p>
			<p>This case also makes visible the <strong>structural limit of logic</strong>. Models, projections, and expert syntheses are indispensable for ordering complexity (Σ), but they encounter a hard boundary where <strong>Λ persists</strong>: uncertainty is not a temporary defect that better reasoning will necessarily eliminate within the decision window. Closure-pressure (∇) arises precisely here, tempting institutions to declare a policy “logically necessary” or “scientifically compelled” in order to mask the remainder. PMS–LOGIC treats this move as illegitimate: logic may integrate, but it may not authorize.</p>
			<p>Distance (Χ) is therefore not optional. Χ prevents the slide from “this is the best integration we can currently achieve” to “this is the justified outcome.” Integration without distance becomes dogma; distance without integration becomes paralysis. PMS–LOGIC stabilizes the configuration by holding both: <strong>coherence without closure</strong>, and <strong>action without justificatory escalation</strong>.</p>
			<p>Self-binding (Ψ) completes the picture. Responsibility here is not a momentary burden attached to a single decision, but a <strong>trajectory-level commitment</strong>: owning the consequences across revisions, corrections, and future reinterpretations (Φ). Policies may change, evidence may evolve, but attribution does not reset. This continuity explains why moral language tends to appear around policy failures or harms, even when no rule was violated and no certainty was available.</p>
			<p>The policy case thus functions as a paradigmatic demonstration of PMS–LOGIC’s core claim: <strong>where asymmetry and time make decisions unavoidable, responsibility becomes readable even when knowledge is incomplete</strong>. Logic’s task is not to eliminate uncertainty, nor to transform it into authority, but to <strong>carry Λ visibly and coherently</strong>. What remains is neither instruction nor absolution, but a structurally disciplined account of why consequences belong to decision-bearing trajectories—without ever introducing an “ought.”</p>
