#  File:           pms-logic.yaml
#  Version:        PMS-LOGIC_1.0 (draft)
#  Last Updated:   2026-01-08
#
#  Summary:
#    This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION PROFILE for the
#    Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS). It provides a structural overlay
#    for the PMS–LOGIC lens (pre-moral foundations, logical limits, post-moral
#    effects), expressed strictly in the canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  Relationship to PMS (non-negotiable):
#    - Depends on the canonical PMS base specification (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#    - Does NOT redefine Δ–Ψ, does NOT add new meta-axioms, and does NOT
#      modify operator dependencies or derived axes.
#    - Introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs: reduced signatures,
#      drift catalogues, scale matrices, example schemas, and (if any)
#      amplification overlays explicitly marked as non-operators.
#
#  Validity Gate (PMS entry condition — application-only):
#    Any USE of this profile as PMS-application presupposes:
#      - Χ (distance),
#      - reversibility (scene-bound, revisable readings),
#      - D (dignity-in-practice; no shaming/ranking; structure-only critique).
#    This gate constrains application, not critique or rejection.

  description: >
    APPLICATION PROFILE for PMS that formalizes the PMS–LOGIC lens: (i) a
    pre-moral level of justification, (ii) a logical level of ordering and
    boundary management, and (iii) a post-moral level of effects. The profile
    expresses the paper strictly in the canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ),
    without redefining operators or altering dependencies. It provides reduced
    signatures, structural failure modes (drift catalogue), failure-mode
    constraints (apparent norms reconstructed pre-morally), an axes projection,
    and an example-suite schema for repository use.

      operator_basis:

      meaning: >
        Marking or occupying a boundary (conceptual, institutional, or personal) is
        a commitment: if the consequences cannot be sustained across time (Θ), the
        boundary becomes destructive rather than orienting.

      meaning: >
        Where a structure does not yield final explanation, forced closure produces
        substitution (dogma, myth, metaphysical compensation, false certainty). PMS

    Paper glossary terms (PMS–LOGIC). Operator definitions remain canonical in PMS.yaml.

    "Closure / Non-Closure (Λ)":

    "Logic (paper-specific)":
      definition: >
        Consistency/derivation plus a closure drive bounded structurally by Λ under □;
        logic is tool, not authority.
    "Moral / Morality":
      definition: >

        generated post hoc under Ω, Θ, Λ, and (functional) Ψ.
    "Norm / Ought":
      definition: "Prescriptive demand ('must', 'should'); no PMS operator generates norms or ought-statements."
    "Non-Innocence":
      definition: "Attributable consequences without intent or command; distinct from guilt or blame."
    "Potential (Capacity)":
      definition: "Effective capacity: □ (situated scope) + Θ (temporal availability); generates exposure, not duty."
    "Structural Failure Mode":
      definition: "Operator distortion leading to structural instability; not a clinical or moral label."
